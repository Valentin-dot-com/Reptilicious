**Meetings**  
We have a standup at 8:30 AM every weekday, with a maximum duration of 20 minutes. We meet on weekdays between 8 AM – 4 PM.

We have check-in meetings at 1 PM every day, lasting a maximum of 20 minutes.

We stick to the meeting times.

We keep our cameras on as much as possible.

During sprint planning, we schedule meetings for the sprint. These are set up in Teams, and all group members are invited.

---

**Communication**  
We use Teams (our group chat) as our communication channel, along with our pre-booked meetings.

If unable to attend, notify the group as soon as you know, preferably at least one day before (the sooner, the better), by accepting/declining the meeting invitation and leaving a message with an explanation in the attendance chat.

In case of illness, notify the group in the same way. The group should be able to make decisions without the absent person. The person should communicate an estimated return time.

**Work**  
We use Sass.

We write code and comments in English!

We use long function and variable names to make their purpose clear at first glance.

We generally write block comments above functions to describe them in more detail.

If we rename a function or variable, we create a commit describing the change.

We use GitHub Projects in our repo for sprint planning and backlog, and create tasks there.

We divide the work during sprint planning and aim for an even workload. If someone finishes their task, they can check if anyone needs help or assign themselves to a new task.

We build the foundation together, and after that, anyone can reach out for help or pair programming if needed.

Omar is the **SCRUM Master**, responsible for keeping time and planning meetings.

We work in the **dev** branch and create individual branches from it.

---

**Commits**  
We write clear commit messages and use **Conventional Commits**.

Example: “add new button to header to restart game”

We make a commit for each separate task, such as creating a function.

---

**Branches**  
We follow **Gitflow** for branch naming.

New branches are created from tasks on GitHub. When starting a task, create a new issue from the task, and from that issue, create a new branch.

---

**Pull Requests & Merges**  
When creating a pull request, assign at least 2 group members to review and approve.

Before merging into **main**, the majority of the group must approve.

Once a branch is merged, it should be deleted.

The person who made the pull request is the one who merges it into **dev**.

**Prettier & ESLint Rules**

- **HTML:** Double quotes `""`, ID names: camelCase, class names: kebab-case
- **SASS:** Written top-down following the HTML structure, all names in kebab-case
- **JS:** Single quotes `''`, camelCase, ID names: camelCase, class names: kebab-case

---

**Timeline**  
The project runs from **Feb 25 – Mar 13**.

If someone falls behind, they should notify the group and ask for help if needed. We are generous with help and support each other.

If someone finishes early, they should ask if anyone needs help or check if they can take on a new task. If all tasks are completed, we can further develop the project and make it more complex.

---

**Time Off**  
We generally do not work on weekends, but anyone who wants to catch up on their own is welcome to do so.

---

**Consequences**  
If someone is not active in the project, we first talk to each other, then contact the teachers if necessary.

If the group cannot reach someone within **24 hours (working day)**, we contact the teachers.
